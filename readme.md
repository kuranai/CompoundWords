I had an interesting idea for a wordlist, to check for maybe free .com domain names.

In the german language we have many compound words, that is not so common in other languages I thought.
So here is my try to stupidly translate the single words and put them back together.

I found a list with many of these words here: https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/philosophische-fakultaet/fachbereiche/neuphilologie/seminar-fuer-sprachwissenschaft/arbeitsbereiche/allg-sprachwissenschaft-computerlinguistik/ressourcen/lexica/germanet-1/beschreibung/compounds/

I imported these to a sql table, used some queries to generate distinct words from these, used these in a google sheet to translate the words,
then imported the result to another sql table and made the final list with some sql.

So maybe someone can use the list for something ...

Some words are interesting, and some just look stupid ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
